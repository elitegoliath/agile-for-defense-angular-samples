# agile-for-defense-angular-samples
Angular and Angular 2 simple application examples.

Two applications able to be ran locally. 1 created with Angular, the other with Angular 2. While running, the application should look and operate identically. Should be well documented with in-code comments as well as an updated README.

###### Outline:
* Introductions
* About Angular 2
    * What is Angular 2
    * Why pay attention to Angular 2
    * The future of Angular 2
    * The intent behind the creation of Angular 2
* Why TypeScript
    * What is TypeScript
    * Why does Angular 2 work better with TypeScript
* Technical Details
    * Compare the simple application designed in Angular with the one designed with Angular 2
    * Compare Angular 2 to various other frameworks?

###### Code Demonstration Concepts:
Items we're looking to demonstrate with this application include
* Components are a key difference between Angular 1 and 2. We want to show at least one component design.
* Change detection is another key difference. We want to show the page updating based on user input.
* Dependency injection appears to be designed differently. We want to show how dependencies are referenced within the application.
* Attribute binding for several key angular attributes is handled differently. We would like to show:
    * repeated elements
    * show/hide of elements
    * change of class or style on elements

###### Application Design:
Load a list of items from a json file and display them. Each item can be starred using an icon that will change style when starred. Each item will have details that can be displayed when a show/hide button/icon/link is clicked. The list will have a search box that allows the user to filter items displayed in the list by title.
